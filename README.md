# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
a) Dataset contain digits 0-9 with a total of 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. Each sample image is 28x28 and linearized as a vector of size 1x784. So, the training and test datasets are 2-d vectors of size 60000x784 and 10000x784 respectively. b) The modelling was done using ANN using tensorflow.
